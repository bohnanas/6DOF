# 6DOF
Simulation of a 6-DOF rigid body aicraft

Verified against NASA test cases 1 and 2.
Case 1: Dragless sphere dropped from altitude (verifies gravitational and translational EOM)
Case 2: Dragless brick dropped from altitude with no damping (verifies rotational EOM)

To do: test case 3, a dragless brick dropped from altitude with damping (verifies inertial coupling)
