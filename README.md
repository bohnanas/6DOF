# 6DOF
Simulation of a 6-DOF rigid body aicraft

Verified against NASA test cases 1, 2, and 3:
Case 1: Dragless sphere dropped from altitude (verifies gravitational and translational EOM)
Case 2: Dragless brick dropped from altitude with no damping (verifies rotational EOM)
Case 3: Dragless brick dropped from altitude with damping (verifies inertial coupling)

To do: add constraints to euler angles so graphs align better, add aircraft model
